# Employee Database

This is an employee database app that runs in the terminal via [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

![Employee tracker preview](./images/employee-tracker.png)

It allows access and control of a database of employees, roles (or titles), and departments, each of which can be added to or deleted from via options on the main menu. Each employee has an assigned role and manager, while each role has an associated department, and each of these relationships is maintained by the SQL data structure.
